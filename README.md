ud120-projects
==============

This repo includes all the project code for the Udacity Intro to Machine Learning course. As I complete modules, I will update the readme to reflect progress. Additionally, you can follow my note taking [here](https://github.com/FrancescoSTL/ud120-projects/blob/master/notes.md). Each project uses scikit-learn to utilize ML algorithms out of the box.

### Index
1. [Initialization](https://github.com/FrancescoSTL/ud120-projects#Initializing)
2. [Running the code](https://github.com/FrancescoSTL/ud120-projects#Running)
3. [My progress](https://github.com/FrancescoSTL/ud120-projects#Progress)

Initializing
------
Before running any code, you'll need to run the startup script in order to download neccessary the necessary datasets. In order to do this:

1. clone the repo by running the following in your terminal:
`git clone https://github.com/FrancescoSTL/ud120-projects.git`

2. Ensure that you have python installed

3. Install scikit-learn by running:
`pip install scikit-learn`

4. navigate to the `tools` directory, and run:
`python startup.py`

And you're ready to roll!

Running
------
Simply navigate to any directory in the folder and run `python projectSpecificFileName_author_id.py`
